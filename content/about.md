I am a computer engineer whose daily work consists of building machine learning models applied to climate forecast. All of the code I write for work is in Python, and the other languages I use to a lesser extent are Lisps and Julia. I currently volunteer at GNU Guix as a package maintainer. My research interests are machine learning, deep learning, autonomous agents, probabilistic programming and uncertainty quantification.
