## Scientific/Research

- [LGB Prec Unc](https://github.com/monego/lgb-prec-unc): Monthly precipitation prediction using gradient boosting with the GPCP dataset with a rolling variance-based UQ. 

- [XGB Prec](https://github.com/monego/xgb-prec): Same as above, but seasonal prediction without UQ and using XGBoost.

- [BSA.py](https://github.com/monego/bsa): Python implementation of the (Backtracking Search Algorithm)[http://pinarcivicioglu.com/bsa.html]. The exact implementation is finished, but I am researching custom operators in a separate branch.

## Web Development

- [WebVO](https://github.com/monego/WebVO): Virtual observatory to run queued astronomical experiments.

## Tooling/Others

- [clitag](https://codeberg.org/monego/clitag): CLI audio tagger, an interface for Python's [mutagen](https://github.com/quodlibet/mutagen) library.

- [ppt](https://codeberg.org/monego/ppt): A CLI (in Bash) tool to download and unpack binaries from release pages, with a purpose similar to that of the [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) app from F-Droid.

## Writing

This website is for personal blogging and portfolio. I have a [professional blog at Medium](https://medium.com/@monaho91) and my scientific publications can be found at my [ResearchGate profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vinicius-Monego).
